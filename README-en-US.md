# Listzy

Listzy is a web-based To-Do List application that supports **dark mode** and **local storage** and features a clean, modern, and responsive interface.  
This is my first portfolio project following my studies in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project aims to allow users to create and manage their daily tasks. Tasks can be easily added, marked as completed, and removed. The state is automatically saved in `localStorage`, preserving the data even after refreshing or closing the browser.
